            The Huracán Performante has reworked the concept of super sports cars and taken the notion of performance to levels never seen before. The vehicle has been re-engineered in its entirety, as regards its weight, engine power, chassis and above all by introducing an innovative system of active aerodynamics: ALA. The use of the awarded Forged Composites®, a shapable forged carbon fiber material patented by Automobili Lamborghini, is a real nice touch and it contributes to make the vehicle even lighter in weight. Besides its extraordinary technological properties, it also conveys a new idea of beauty.
