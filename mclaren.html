            The 720S embodies our relentless quest to push the limits of possibility. Lighter, stronger, faster. It’s all of these and more. But how it makes you feel is altogether something else. Prepare to push the limits of what you thought possible in a supercar.
            <br> <br> An innovation of the technology first seen in the McLaren P1™ hypercar, the MonoCage II is a one-piece carbon fibre tub that now includes the roof. Unique to the supercar category, this high-strength, low-weight passenger cell provides unrivalled rigidity, resulting in thrilling driving dynamics and exceptional protection for you and your passenger. The MonoCage II, unique to the 720S, extends over the engine bay and includes wider door apertures that open into the roof.
